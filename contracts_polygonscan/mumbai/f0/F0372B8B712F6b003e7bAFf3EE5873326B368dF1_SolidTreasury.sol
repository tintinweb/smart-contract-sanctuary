     * Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following

     *  - an externally-owned account

     *  - an address where a contract will be created
     *  - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed
     * ====

     * [IMPORTANT]
     * ====
     * You shouldn't rely on `isContract` to protect against flash loan attacks!
     *
     * Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged. It breaks composability, breaks support for smart wallets
     * like Gnosis Safe, and does not provide security since it can be circumvented by calling from a contract
     * constructor.
