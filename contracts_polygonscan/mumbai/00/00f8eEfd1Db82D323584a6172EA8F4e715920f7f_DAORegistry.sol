/* This is the Rhada parent contract. Here is the following flow:
 * DAOs will register to join the Rhada protocol and will list the following:
 *      - Address of the contract/user that will interact with the Rhada Protocol
 *      - Funds/Fund type: funds can come later but addresses of the DAO's ERC20 token
 * Upon registering,
 *      - Will deploy a new ContributorRegistry contract specific to that DAO
 *              - Manages devs, voting process for who is a contributor
 *              - Need to launch here, don't need in struct. RoundManager uses its data, not this contract
 *      - Will deploy a new RoundVoting contract specific to that DAO
 *              - Manages rounds and voting on specific users in a round. Used to define how salary gets split
 *              - Possible (and probably necessary) feature: rewards DAO members for participating
 *      - Will deploy a PaymentStream contract specific to that DAO
 *              - Controls the setting up of payments
 * DAO parent address will map to address of each one
 * Contracts compiles data from all of them
 *      - ContributorRegistry
 *          - Don't know what to use from this
 *      - RoundVoting
 *          - Needs votes + users (will use to split salary among them all)
 *      - PaymentStream
 *          - Will start payment stream from this contract
 * Also managed here:
 *      - Weighted voting (DAO -> weighted voting. Can act as a user registry per DAO)
 *      - Lists all contributors, payments streams, and other important data
