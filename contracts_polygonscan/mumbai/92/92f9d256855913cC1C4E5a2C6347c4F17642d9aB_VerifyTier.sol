/// celebrity status, age, health, accredited investor, social media account,
/// etc. etc.
///
/// Typically crypto can't and doesn't want to deal with this issue. The usual

///
/// - Data breaches that put individual's safety at risk. Consider the December
///   2020 leak from Ledger that dumped 270 000 home addresses and phone

/// - Discriminatory access, undermining an individual's self-sovereign right
///   to run a full node, self-host a GUI and broadcast transactions onchain.
///   Consider the dydx airdrop of 2021 where metadata about a user's access
///   patterns logged on a server were used to deny access to presumed
///   Americans over regulatory fears.
/// - An entrenched supply chain of centralized actors from regulators, to
///   government databases, through KYC corporations, platforms, etc. each of
///   which holds an effective monopoly over, and ability to manipulate user's
///   "own" identity.
///
/// These examples and others are completely antithetical to and undermine the
/// safety of an opt-in, permissionless system based on pseudonomous actors
/// self-signing actions into a shared space.
///
/// That said, one can hardly expect a permissionless pseudonomous system
/// founded on asynchronous value transfers to succeed without at least some
/// concept of curation and reputation.
///
/// Anon, will you invest YOUR money in anon's project?
///
/// Clearly for every defi blue chip there are 10 000 scams and nothing onchain
/// can stop a scam, this MUST happen at the social layer.
///
/// Rain protocol is agnostic to how this verification happens. A government
/// regulator is going to want a government issued ID cross-referenced against
/// international sanctions. A fan of some social media influencer wants to
/// see a verified account on that platform. An open source software project
/// should show a github profile. A security token may need evidence from an
/// accountant showing accredited investor status. There are so many ways in
/// which BOTH sides of a fundraise may need to verify something about
/// themselves to each other via a THIRD PARTY that Rain cannot assume much.
///
/// The trust model and process for Rain verification is:
///
/// - There are many `Verify` contracts, each represents a specific
///   verification method with a (hopefully large) set of possible reviewers.
/// - The verifyee compiles some evidence that can be referenced by ID in some
///   relevant system. It could be a session ID in a KYC provider's database or
///   a tweet from a verified account, etc. The ID is a `uint256` so should be
///   enough to fit just about any system ID, it is large enough to fit a hash,
///   2x UUIDs or literally any sequential ID.
/// - The verifyee calls `add` _for themselves_ to include their ID under their
///   account, after which they _cannot change_ their submission without
///   appealing to someone who can remove. This costs gas, so why don't we
///   simply ask the user to sign something and have an approver verify the
///   signed data? Because we want to leverage both the censorship resistance
///   and asynchronous nature of the underlying blockchain. Assuming there are
///   N possible approvers, we want ANY 1 of those N approvers to be able to
///   review and approve an application. If the user is forced to submit their
///   application directly to one SPECIFIC approver we lose this property. In
///   the gasless model the user must then rely on their specific approver both
///   being online and not to censor the request. It's also possible that many
///   accounts add the same ID, after all the ID will be public onchain, so it
///   is important for approvers to verify the PAIRING between account and ID.
/// - ANY account with the `APPROVER` role can review the added ID against the
///   records in the system referenced by the ID. IF the ID is valid then the
///   `approve` function should be called by the approver.
/// - ANY account with the `BANNER` role can veto either an add OR a prior
///   approval. In the case of a false positive, i.e. where an account was
///   mistakenly approved, an appeal can be made to a banner to update the
///   status. Bad accounts SHOULD BE BANNED NOT REMOVED. When an account is
///   removed, its onchain state is once again open for the attacker to
///   resubmit a new fraudulent session ID and potentially be reapproved.
///   Once an account is banned, any attempt by the account holder to change
///   their session ID, or an approver to approve will be rejected. Downstream
///   consumers of a `State` MUST check for an existing ban.
///   - ANY account with the `REMOVER` role can scrub the `State` from an
///   account. Of course, this is a blockchain so the state changes are all
///   still visible to full nodes and indexers in historical data, in both the
///   onchain history and the event logs for each state change. This allows an
///   account to appeal to a remover in the case of a MISTAKEN BAN or also in
///   the case of a MISTAKEN ADD (e.g. wrong ID value), effecting a
///   "hard reset" at the contract storage level.
///

/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.
