// Simple version of Black Jack. The player actions are hit and stand. Other
// options such as double down, split, and surrender are not implemented.
//
// Game play:
//
// It is each player against the house, players are not up against each
// other. The goal of the game is to have a higher score than the house
// while having a score that is less than or equal to 21. 21, Blackjack,
// is the best score.
//
// Players join the game by putting down chips (money). Those chips
// are then locked in the game during play. The house then deals themselves
// one card. Each player can then request to have their two cards.
// Now the player can stand, meaning they won't take more cards and
// are done. The other option is to hit, which means they get dealt another
// card. They can hit as much as they want until they either bust (over 21)
// or decide to stand. Once all players are done or the time limit has run
// out it is the house's turn. The house draws a single card at a time
// until they have a score that is greater than or equal to 17. At that
// point the results can be calculated. If the house has a higher score
// than a player the house gets their chips. If the house has a lower
// score than a player the player gets two times their amount of chips
// back. If the house ties a player the player gets just their chips
// back. If the house busts and a player doesn't the players wins. If
// the house does not bust and the player does the house wins. If both
// the house and the player bust the house wins.
//
// If the player wins or ties they can withdraw those funds for that round.
//
// Improvements:
// - Implement the full suite of player actions (double down, split, etc...)
// - The contract is close to the max size. Because of that I removed some
//   variables that make the code more readable. Afterwards I split this
//   contract into two BlackJack & BlackJackBase to reduce the size. But
//   I did not go back and add in variables that make the code more readable.
//   Consider if it is worth adding those back in or if those changes also
//   help reduce gas and if so keep them in.
// - The shuffle is deterministic. If someone really wanted to peak
//   ahead to what card they might draw to get an unfair advantage they could.
//   Move to something like chain.link that has verified random values.
// - There is no notion of a deck, the cards are entirely random on every draw.
//   Implement some sort of deck so there are N decks worth of cards where N
//   is a number based on the number of players.
// - Allow players to withdraw for the current round if the game hasn't started.
