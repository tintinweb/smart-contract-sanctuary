  A few words about why we include a `prev` field, and why we don't include a
  `next` field: in theory clients should need neither `prev` nor a `next` field.
  They could just 1. Read the order book state at a given block `b`.  2. On
  every event, update a local copy of the orderbook.  But in practice, we do not
  want to force clients to keep a copy of the *entire* orderbook. There may be a
  long tail of spam. Now if they only start with the first $N$ offers and
  receive a new offer that goes to the end of the book, they cannot tell if
  there are missing offers between the new offer and the end of the local copy
  of the book.
  
  So we add a prev pointer so clients with only a prefix of the book can receive
  out-of-prefix offers and know what to do with them. The `next` pointer is an
  optimization useful in Solidity (we traverse fewer memory locations) but
  useless in client code.

     It also specify with `gasreq` how much gas should be given when executing their offer.

     `gasprice` indicates an upper bound on the gasprice at which the maker is ready to be penalised if their offer fails. Any value below the Mangrove's internal `gasprice` configuration value will be ignored.

    `gasreq`, together with `gasprice`, will contribute to determining the penalty provision set aside by the Mangrove from the market maker's `balanceOf` balance.

  An offer cannot be inserted in a closed market, nor when a reentrancy lock for `outbound_tkn`,`inbound_tkn` is on.

  /* A market order specifies a (`outbound_tkn`,`inbound_tkn`) pair, a desired total amount of `outbound_tkn` (`takerWants`), and an available total amount of `inbound_tkn` (`takerGives`). It returns two `uint`s: the total amount of `outbound_tkn` received and the total amount of `inbound_tkn` spent.

     The `takerGives/takerWants` ratio induces a maximum average price that the taker is ready to pay across all offers that will be executed during the market order. It is thus possible to execute an offer with a price worse than the initial (`takerGives`/`takerWants`) ratio given as argument to `marketOrder` if some cheaper offers were executed earlier in the market order.

  The market order stops when the price has become too high, or when the end of the book has been reached, or:
  * If `fillWants` is true, the market order stops when `takerWants` units of `outbound_tkn` have been obtained. With `fillWants` set to true, to buy a specific volume of `outbound_tkn` at any price, set `takerWants` to the amount desired and `takerGives` to $2^{160}-1$.
  * If `fillWants` is false, the taker is filling `gives` instead: the market order stops when `takerGives` units of `inbound_tkn` have been sold. With `fillWants` set to false, to sell a specific volume of `inbound_tkn` at any price, set `takerGives` to the amount desired and `takerWants` to $0$. */

      Let $o_w$ be `offerWants`, $o_g$ be `offerGives`, $t_w$ be `takerWants`, $t_g$ be `takerGives`, and `f ∈ {w,g}` be $w$ if `fillWants` is true, $g$ otherwise.

      Let $\textrm{got}$ be the amount that the taker will receive, and $\textrm{gave}$ be the amount that the taker will pay.

      #### Case $f = w$

      If $f = w$, let $\textrm{got} = \min(o_g,t_w)$, and let $\textrm{gave} = \left\lceil\dfrac{o_w \textrm{got}}{o_g}\right\rceil$. This is well-defined since, for live offers, $o_g > 0$.

      In plain english, we only give to the taker up to what they wanted (or what the offer has to give), and follow the offer price to determine what the taker will give.

      Since $\textrm{gave}$ is rounded up, the price might be overevaluated. Still, we cannot spend more than what the taker specified as `takerGives`. At this point [we know](#MgvOfferTaking/checkPrice) that $o_w t_w \leq o_g t_g$, so since $t_g$ is an integer we have
      
      $t_g \geq \left\lceil\dfrac{o_w t_w}{o_g}\right\rceil \geq \left\lceil\dfrac{o_w \textrm{got}}{o_g}\right\rceil = \textrm{gave}$.


      #### Case $f = g$

      If $f = g$, let $\textrm{gave} = \min(o_w,t_g)$, and $\textrm{got} = o_g$ if $o_w = 0$, $\textrm{got} = \left\lfloor\dfrac{o_g \textrm{gave}}{o_w}\right\rfloor$ otherwise.

      In plain english, we spend up to what the taker agreed to pay (or what the offer wants), and follow the offer price to determine what the taker will get. This may exceed $t_w$.

      #### Price adjustment

      Prices are rounded up to ensure maker is not drained on small amounts. It's economically unlikely, but `density` protects the taker from being drained anyway so it is better to default towards protecting the maker here.
      */

      /*
      ### Implementation

      First we check the cases $(f=w \wedge o_g < t_w)\vee(f_g \wedge o_w < t_g)$, in which case the above spec simplifies to $\textrm{got} = o_g, \textrm{gave} = o_w$.

      Otherwise the offer may be partially consumed.
      
      In the case $f=w$ we don't touch $\textrm{got}$ (which was initialized to $t_w$) and compute $\textrm{gave} = \left\lceil\dfrac{o_w t_w}{o_g}\right\rceil$. As shown above we have $\textrm{gave} \leq t_g$.

      In the case $f=g$ we don't touch $\textrm{gave}$ (which was initialized to $t_g$) and compute $\textrm{got} = o_g$ if $o_w = 0$, and $\textrm{got} = \left\lfloor\dfrac{o_g t_g}{o_w}\right\rfloor$ otherwise.

/* `MgvRoot` and its descendants describe an orderbook-based exchange ("the Mangrove") where market makers *do not have to provision their offer*. See `structs.js` for a longer introduction. In a nutshell: each offer created by a maker specifies an address (`maker`) to call upon offer execution by a taker. In the normal mode of operation, the Mangrove transfers the amount to be paid by the taker to the maker, calls the maker, attempts to transfer the amount promised by the maker to the taker, and reverts if it cannot.

   There is one Mangrove contract that manages all tradeable pairs. This reduces deployment costs for new pairs and lets market makers have all their provision for all pairs in the same place.

   The interaction map between the different actors is as follows:
   <img src="./contactMap.png" width="190%"></img>

   The sequence diagram of a market order is as follows:
   <img src="./sequenceChart.png" width="190%"></img>

   There is a secondary mode of operation in which the _maker_ flashloans the sold amount to the taker.

   The Mangrove contract is `abstract` and accomodates both modes. Two contracts, `Mangrove` and `InvertedMangrove` inherit from it, one per mode of operation.

   The contract structure is as follows:
