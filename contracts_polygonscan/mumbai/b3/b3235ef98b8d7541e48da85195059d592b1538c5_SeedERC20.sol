/// When the last seed token is distributed the `SeedERC20`

/// For our use-case the recipient is a `Trust` contract but `SeedERC20`

/// unit represents a meaningful contribution to keep dust out of the system.
///
/// The contract lifecycle is split into two phases:
///
/// - `Phase.ZERO`: the `seed` and `unseed` functions are callable by anyone.

/// When `seed` is called the `SeedERC20` contract takes ownership of reserve

/// When `unseed` is called the `SeedERC20` contract takes ownership of seed
