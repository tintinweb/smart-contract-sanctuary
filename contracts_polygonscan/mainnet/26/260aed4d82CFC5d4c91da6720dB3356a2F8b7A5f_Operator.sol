/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

// The state for claimable rewards from the Rewarder contract please see contracts/application/RewarderV1.sol.
// Calculating rewards is tricky. We are using contracts with logic derived from the OG rewards contract, Sushiswap's Masterchef.sol: 
// https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/master/contracts/MasterChef.sol

// Copied verbatim from the original contract:

    // We do some fancy math here. Basically, any point in time, the amount of SUSHIs
    // entitled to a user but is pending to be distributed is:
    //
    //   pending reward = (user.amount * pool.accSushiPerShare) - user.rewardDebt
    //
    // Whenever a user deposits or withdraws LP tokens to a pool. Here's what happens:
    //   1. The pool's `accSushiPerShare` (and `lastRewardBlock`) gets updated.
    //   2. User receives the pending reward sent to his/her address.
    //   3. User's `amount` gets updated.
    //   4. User's `rewardDebt` gets updated.

// Default's rewarder uses the same mechanism but with drastically simplified logic:
// 1. we have a single pool (USDC Vault), so we can remove all pool allocation logic
// 2. distribution epochs are weekly instead of per block, so 
// 3. there is no special multiplier logic for early participants
// 4. minting happens outside the contract, and reward tokens are sent in (instead of directly minted)

// note: we are also changing the "rewardDebt" variable to "ineligbleRewards" for contract clarity.

// For formal paper for this strategy, see: https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ad71ffeb79acc67c8bcdaba/5ad8d1193a40977462982470_scalable-reward-distribution-paper.pdf
