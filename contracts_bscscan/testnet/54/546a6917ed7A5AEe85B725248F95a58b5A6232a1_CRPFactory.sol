/**
 * @author Balancer Labs
 * @title Smart Pool with customizable features
 * @notice PCToken is the "Balancer Smart Pool" token (transferred upon finalization)
 * @dev Rights are defined as follows (index values into the array)
 *      0: canPauseSwapping - can setPublicSwap back to false after turning it on
 *                            by default, it is off on initialization and can only be turned on
 *      1: canChangeSwapFee - can setSwapFee after initialization (by default, it is fixed at create time)
 *      2: canChangeWeights - can bind new token weights (allowed by default in base pool)
 *      3: canAddRemoveTokens - can bind/unbind tokens (allowed by default in base pool)
 *      4: canWhitelistLPs - can restrict LPs to a whitelist
 *      5: canChangeCap - can change the BSP cap (max # of pool tokens)
 *
 * Note that functions called on bPool and bFactory may look like internal calls,
 *   but since they are contracts accessed through an interface, they are really external.
 * To make this explicit, we could write "IBPool(address(bPool)).function()" everywhere,
 *   instead of "bPool.function()".

 * @author Ampleforth engineering team & Balancer Labs
 *
 * Reference:
 * https://github.com/balancer-labs/configurable-rights-pool/blob/master/contracts/templates/ElasticSupplyPool.sol
 *
 * @title Ampl Elastic Configurable Rights Pool.
 *
 * @dev   Extension of Balancer labs' configurable rights pool (smart-pool).
 *        Amples are a dynamic supply tokens, supply and individual balances change daily by a Rebase operation.
 *        In constant-function markets, Ampleforth's supply adjustments result in Impermanent Loss (IL)
 *        to liquidity providers. The AmplElasticCRP is an extension of Balancer Lab's
 *        ConfigurableRightsPool which mitigates IL induced by supply adjustments.
 *
 *        It accomplishes this by doing the following mechanism:
 *        The `resyncWeight` method will be invoked atomically after rebase through Ampleforth's orchestrator.
 *
 *        When rebase changes supply, ampl weight is updated to the geometric mean of
 *        the current ampl weight and the target. Every other token's weight is updated
 *        proportionally such that relative ratios are same.
 *
 *        Weights: {w_ampl, w_t1 ... w_tn}
 *
 *        Rebase_change: x% (Ample's supply changes by x%, can be positive or negative)
 *
 *        Ample target weight: w_ampl_target = (100+x)/100 * w_ampl
 *
 *        w_ampl_new = sqrt(w_ampl * w_ampl_target)  // geometric mean
 *        for i in tn:
 *           w_ti_new = (w_ampl_new * w_ti) / w_ampl_target

/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.
