/*

  Decentralized digital asset exchange. Supports any digital asset that can be represented on the Ethereum blockchain (i.e. - transferred in an Ethereum transaction or sequence of transactions).

  Let us suppose two agents interacting with a distributed ledger have utility functions preferencing certain states of that ledger over others.
  Aiming to maximize their utility, these agents may construct with their utility functions along with the present ledger state a mapping of state transitions (transactions) to marginal utilities.
  Any composite state transition with positive marginal utility for and enactable by the combined permissions of both agents thus is a mutually desirable trade, and the trustless 
  code execution provided by a distributed ledger renders the requisite atomicity trivial.

  Relative to this model, this instantiation makes two concessions to practicality:
  - State transition preferences are not matched directly but instead intermediated by a standard of tokenized value.
  - A small fee can be charged in WYV for order settlement in an amount configurable by the frontend hosting the orderbook.

  Solidity presently possesses neither a first-class functional typesystem nor runtime reflection (ABI encoding in Solidity), so we must be a bit clever in implementation and work at a lower level of abstraction than would be ideal.

  We elect to utilize the following structure for the initial version of the protocol:
  - Buy-side and sell-side orders each provide callData (bytes) - for a sell-side order, the state transition for sale, for a buy-side order, the state transition to be bought.
    Along with the callData, orders provide `replacementPattern`: a bytemask indicating which bytes of the callData can be changed (e.g. NFT destination address).
    When a buy-side and sell-side order are matched, the desired callDatas are unified, masked with the bytemasks, and checked for agreement.
    This alone is enough to implement common simple state transitions, such as "transfer my CryptoKitty to any address" or "buy any of this kind of nonfungible token".
  - Orders (of either side) can optionally specify a static (no state modification) callback function, which receives configurable data along with the actual callData as a parameter.
    Although it requires some encoding acrobatics, this allows for arbitrary transaction validation functions.
    For example, a buy-sider order could express the intent to buy any CryptoKitty with a particular set of characteristics (checked in the static call),
    or a sell-side order could express the intent to sell any of three ENS names, but not two others.
    Use of the EVM's STATICCALL opcode, added in Ethereum Metropolis, allows the static callData to be safely specified separately and thus this kind of matching to happen correctly
    - that is to say, wherever the two (transaction => bool) functions intersect.

  Future protocol versions may improve upon this structure in capability or usability according to protocol user feedback demand, with upgrades enacted by the Wyvern DAO.
