    Welcome to GEN2
    The Official Token for the GenTokens Community!

    What is GEN2?
    
    We have two official GEN tokens. This one (GEN2)
    and also the original GEN (0xd4294c0f64eba74089315d4b0278698f7181037e)
    
    They both provide holders with the same benefit.
    If you hold GEN OR GEN2 you will have early access 
    to all future tokens that are released via our LaunchPad.
    
    More on that later... but why GEN2?
    
    GEN (1) is renounced. I cannot micro-manage the tokenomics and it does not 
    provide any money for marketing.
    
    GEN2 will never be renounced! So I can adjust the tokenomics and micro-manage its 
    growth. It also has a marketing wallet that pays in BNB. Which will provide us 
    with plenty of money for promoting GEN and GEN2 going forward. 
    
    This puts us in a very unique position. We have 2 tokens, that give you 
    the same benefit for holding... but you get to choose, renounced or micro-managed! 
    
    So let's talk about the benefits of holding GEN or GEN2....
    
    The GenTokens Launch Pad!
    
    Have you ever watched the APE tool on poocoin? When a token pops up, if you buy
    first you could make a fortune! But... it's probably a scam, so you can't just 
    APE in, you have to do some checks first. 
    
    Checks take time.... and while you do your due diligence the price is going up! 
    Add even worse, after you've done all of your checks, the coin can still RUG!
    
    I'd guess that 95% of tokens that you see on the APE tool are scams. Maybe more.
    
    Imagine if you could just buy the token the moment it launches, knowing with 100% 
    confidence that it is safe...
    
    Well that's the GenTokens LaunchPad!
    
    We provide tokens that are guaranteed to be safe. You don't have to do any checks
    at all, you can APE in with total confidence and buy immediately after launch. 
    
    Our LaunchPad deploys tokens in 4 stages... 
    
    Stage 1
    
    Members of our 'Approved Community' buy first. Nobody else! No bots! No Strangers! No Risk! 
    How do you get to become a member of this elite community? Members are handpicked and added 
    personally by me, or a member of my very trusted team. We watch our community at GEN very 
    carefully, if we see that you are helping out, answering questions, offering support and 
    guidance to other members of the community we invite you in. 
    
    Oh, and there is one last very important check....
    
    My heart. 
    
    I trust my heart over EVERYTHING. If I get a bad feeling about you, you will not get in!
    My heart always has the final say. I am extremely intuitive and it has never let me down. 
    
    If you're a good, wholesome person, my heart will like you ;) 
    
    This inner core of members are people I trust completely. However, I still need to protect 
    non-members, so Stage 1 has a very strict holder limit. Nobody can buy more than 
    2% of a token supply, avoiding the risk of a whale wallet from within the community.
    
    As well as being hand picked for the 'Approved Community' all members must hold GEN or GEN2 
    in order to be able to buy.
    
    Stage 2 
    
    The next people that get to buy are the main GEN community members. These are the people in our 
    Telegram group, When it is time for them to buy I will announce the new token to the group and 
    anybody that wants to buy needs to send me their wallet address, so I can add it to the approved list. 
    
    Only wallets that I personally approve can buy. Again... no bots can touch us. And these people must
    hold GEN or GEN2 to be able to buy. 
    
    Stage 3 
    
    At stage 3 we open up to the entire GEN community. At this stage all people holding GEN or GEN2 can buy.
    But nobody else. I am aware that a bot user can hold GEN or GEN2 and potential buy at this stage. I personally 
    scrutinise all sales very carefully. Anybody using a bot will be blacklisted, and their tokens locked.
    
    Stage 4 
    
    We open up to the public. Anybody can buy... and we watch the transactions very carefully. If necessary, we 
    pause the contract to blacklist bots! 
    
    We take these measures to ensure a safe launch. We want to protect our community from the bots, and from 
    each other! So no whale wallets, and no bots! By restricting our launches to good people that we trust we
    give our tokens the very best start.
    
    Our launches are discreet for a reason. We are not trying to create hype to get a 1000x token seconds after launch.
    This activity attracts a lot of attention from bot users! We deploy discreetly to a community we trust, and slowly 
    open up to a larger community at each stage.
    
    By the time bots can buy, they don't want to buy! They are only interested in getting in first. And that simply is
    not possible due to the way we deploy our contracts.
    
    Then we promote. 
    
    A final word on bots....
    
    If you use bots, then expect your wallet to be blacklisted. I use several ways of discreetly
    detecting bots (none of which are revealed in this contract) if I detect that you are using a bot 
    (on ANY contract, not just GEN or GEN2) I will blacklist your wallet. 
    
    This brings us on to our....
    
    TERMS OF SALE 
    
    If you use bots, you are not permitted to purchase GEN, GEN2 or any future token that launches via the
    GenTokens LaunchPad. Any purchase that you make will be considered a 100% donation to the GEN community.
    Your account will be locked and you will not be able to sell or swap your tokens. 
    
    We do not permit bots at all. Of ANY kind. If you use them, do not attempt to buy GEN or GEN2. You will 
    lose your money. 
    
    So... hopefully we only have the good, wholesome, and honest people left. 
    
    ....Hello Guys!!! :)
    
    So what is this LaunchPad thing???? 
    
    Well, you already know how the deployment works, but what about the tokens? 
    
    We use our LaunchPad to launch safe community and charity tokens that we hand over 
    to other people to promote and manage. This could be you! 
    
    Each token goes through the same strict deployment stages to ensure its safety before 
    you adopt it as your own. 
    
    We also support other teams by creating "use purpose", lottery, and giveaway tokens. 
    
    Full details of how the GenTokens LaunchPad works, and how you can have your very own 
    token launch safely using our system are provided on our website. 
    
    Now lets chat about GEN2
    
    Our tokenomics....
    
    Redistribution to Holders (Reflection)
    
    We have a redistribution fee of 3% on all transactions. 
    To get more GEN2, just buy and hold. Every transaction puts more GEN2 in your wallet 
    completely automatically 
    
    Auto-Liquidity 
    
    We have a 3% fee on all transactions that is added to the liquidity pool for GEN2
    
    Burned Liquidity 
    
    Our initial Liquidity is not locked... it is burned. We can never remove it. The auto 
    liquidity is also burned. Of course, GEN2 holders can add liquidity if they wish,
    but everything we add is burned! 
    
    Giveaways and Manual Burns 
    
    We have a 2% fee on all transactions that pays in GEN2 tokens into a very special wallet 
    We NEVER sell the tokens in this wallet! 
    
    We use them in 2 very clever ways.... 
    
    1. We use them for Giveaways, that we run via the Gleam.io platform
    live on YouTube, this helps to promote GEN and GEN2
    
    2. If the price of GEN2 drops, due to people selling or general market conditions, we 
    manually burn some tokens from this wallet to recover the $ value on GEN2
    
    When this wallet is holding more tokens than we need, we lower the fee to 0% and we 
    move the 2% to other places where it can be used most effectively. Either to the 
    Auto-Liquidity, the marketing wallet or to boost the redistribution to holders. 
    
    Finally, we have the marketing wallet. This takes a 3% fee on all transactions, it 
    is paid directly to the wallet in BNB and is used to cover all of our expenses and 
    pay for marketing of GEN and GEN2
    
    The initial Burn (What some people refer to as the Black Hole!) 
    
    The total supply of GEN2 at launch is 1000000000 * 10**6 * 10**9 
    We will burn 10% of the initial supply. This means that the burn wallet is counted as 
    a holder of GEN2, and is included in the redistribution reward. So every transaction
    some tokens are automatically burned. Burning tokens lowers the total supply,
    which increase the value of all remaining tokens... which you hold! 
    
    Transaction Limits 
    
    We have max transaction limits and max token holding limits.
    
    At launch, the max transaction limit is 1% of the total supply, and the 
    max holding limit is 2% of the total supply. These will be micro-managed as needed
    as GEN2 holders grow.
    
    All of our decisions have been made to make GEN, GEN2 and the GenTokens LaunchPad
    as safe, and profitable as possible for you.
    
    We are overwhelmed by the amazing support and goodness that we see within our 
    community. You are all really great people, and it is my wish that what we are
    doing will make you all very very rich! 
    
    Or at the very least.... recover any money you have ever lost in this crazy 
    world of crypto and ensure that you never lose any again! 
    
    Thank you for being a part of our community and making GenTokens Great! 
    
    GEN
    10th June 2021... in the middle of the night with some tea and biscuits.
