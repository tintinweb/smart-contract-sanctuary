  // When `balanceOf(_user)` is changed (via minting/burning/transferring tokens),
  //   `dividendOf(_user)` should not be changed,
  //   but the computed value of `dividendPerShare * balanceOf(_user)` is changed.
  // To keep the `dividendOf(_user)` unchanged, we add a correction term:
  //   `dividendOf(_user) = dividendPerShare * balanceOf(_user) + dividendCorrectionOf(_user)`,
  //   where `dividendCorrectionOf(_user)` is updated whenever `balanceOf(_user)` is changed:
  //   `dividendCorrectionOf(_user) = dividendPerShare * (old balanceOf(_user)) - (new balanceOf(_user))`.
  // So now `dividendOf(_user)` returns the same value before and after `balanceOf(_user)` is changed.

 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
