 * the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.
 * Both {IERC777-Sent} and {IERC20-Transfer} events are emitted on token

 * Additionally, the {IERC777-granularity} value is hard-coded to `1`, meaning that there
 * are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or
 * destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless.

 * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to

 * can later be changed with {transferOwnership}.
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to
