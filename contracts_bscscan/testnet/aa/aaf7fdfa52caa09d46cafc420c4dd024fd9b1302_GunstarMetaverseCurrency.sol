    * {_snapshot} is `internal` and you have to decide how to expose it externally. Its usage may be restricted to a
    * set of accounts, for example using {AccessControl}, or it may be open to the public.
    *
    * [WARNING]
    * ====
    * While an open way of calling {_snapshot} is required for certain trust minimization mechanisms such as forking,
    * you must consider that it can potentially be used by attackers in two ways.
    *
    * First, it can be used to increase the cost of retrieval of values from snapshots, although it will grow
    * logarithmically thus rendering this attack ineffective in the long term. Second, it can be used to target
    * specific accounts and increase the cost of ERC20 transfers for them, in the ways specified in the Gas Costs
    * section above.
    *
    * We haven't measured the actual numbers; if this is something you're interested in please reach out to us.
