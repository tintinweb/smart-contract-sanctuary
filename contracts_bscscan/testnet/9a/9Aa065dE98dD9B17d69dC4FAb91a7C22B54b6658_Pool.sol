 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.

 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
