 * VersionedInitializable
 * -
 * Helper contract to support initializer functions. To use it, replace
 * the constructor with a function that has the `initializer` modifier.
 * WARNING: Unlike constructors, initializer functions must be manually
 * invoked. This applies both to deploying an Initializable contract, as well
 * as extending an Initializable contract via inheritance.
 * WARNING: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke
 * a parent initializer twice, or ensure that all initializers are idempotent,
 * because this is not dealt with automatically as with constructors.
 * -
 * This contract was cloned from Populous and modified to work with the Populous World eco-system.
