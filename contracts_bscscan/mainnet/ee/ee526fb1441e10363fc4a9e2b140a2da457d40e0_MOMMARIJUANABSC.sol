 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit

    // Anytime there is division, there is a risk of numerical instability from rounding errors. In
    // order to minimize this risk, we adhere to the following guidelines:
    // 1) The conversion rate adopted is the number of shares that equals 1 D100.
    //    The inverse rate must not be used--totalShares is always the numerator and _totalSupply is
    //    always the denominator. (i.e. If you want to convert shares to D100 instead of
    //    multiplying by the inverse rate, you should divide by the normal rate)
    // 2) Share balances converted into D100Token are always rounded down (truncated).
    //
    // We make the following guarantees:
    // - If address 'A' transfers x D100Token to address 'B'. A's resulting external balance will
    //   be decreased by precisely x D100Token, and B's external balance will be precisely
    //   increased by x D100Token.
    //
    // We do not guarantee that the sum of all balances equals the result of calling totalSupply().
    // This is because, for any conversion function 'f()' that has non-zero rounding error,
    // f(x0) + f(x1) + ... + f(xn) is not always equal to f(x0 + x1 + ... xn).
