    📩TG: t.me/MoZillaOfficial

    Just when you thought you’ve missed out on the Zilla hype, here comes MoZilla. ☄️
    Don’t miss out or your eyes will be on fire watching the chart moon as fast as lightning. 🚀🔥

    🔶Tokenomics🔶

     1,000,000,000,000 Tokens
     Decimals: 18
     Symbol: MoZilla

    🔶Tax Breakdown🔶

    🔶2% Marketing Wallet
    🔶2% Burn Fee
    🔶4% Liquidity
    🔶4% Reflections

Does the burn fee benefit me as a holder?

Yes, it does, although sending tokens to the burn address does not directly affect the token price. Instead, it takes tokens permanently out of circulation. The effect of removing tokens from circulation decreases the market cap. This stabilizes the token price because it increases the ratio of BNB available in the Liquidity Pool to cover the market cap. 

For example, if a token has $1,000,000 worth of BNB in the Liquidity Pool and a $10,000,000 market cap, 10% of that total market value is covered by the available funds. This creates a situation where all LP token swaps have a price impact 10x of the swaps face value. So if $1,000 is swapped, the market cap would change by $10,000. If we jump forward in time after many transactions have taken place, and for the sake of a straightforward calculation, let’s say the available funds in the LP is still $1,000,000, the price has stayed relatively consistent. Still, many transactions have taken place, and many tokens have been removed from circulation, leaving the new market cap at $5,000,000. 

The ratio of available BNB to cover the market cap is at 20%, and the price will fluctuate less on large trades. We’ve all heard of the term ‘bubble’; the bubble is the gap between the market cap and the available funds to cover the market cap. The way DogeZilla and others operate with these backwards liquidity additions continually shift that percentage in the wrong direction making things more unstable as time goes on.
