$EARN CAKE Token

$EARN CAKE is a Secure Moonrat Token fork with bug fixes and additional anti-bot / anti-whale features added

Tokenomics:

* Uses the Pancake V2 Router to lock liquidity and for buying/selling.

* 20% Total Tax (20%+ Slippage a must)

    * 5% Reflect Tax

    * 15% Liquidity Tax (4% to Liquidity, 4% to BNB pool)

* Max Transaction at launch: 10 Billion Tokens (0.5% of total supply, 1% of circulating supply) (Will be increased to 50 Billion (5% of circulating supply) 30 minutes after launch) - Intended to keep bots at bay during fair launch. 

* Min Liquidity Lock Amount: 500 Million Tokens

* Each purchase increases CAKE Claim Timer based on purchase token amount relative to existing balance, up to 1 full claim cycle (1 day for 2 weeks, 3 days thereafter) if more than doubling holdings.

CAKE is claimable daily for the first two weeks, then every 3 days afterwards.

/**
 * @dev Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.
 *
 * Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the {nonReentrant} modifier
 * available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested
 * (reentrant) calls to them.
 *
 * Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions EARN CAKEked as
 * `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making
 * those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry
 * points to them.
 *
 * TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways
 * to protect against it, check out our blog post
