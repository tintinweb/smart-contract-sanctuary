     *The project party has the confidence and ability to increase the value of the tokens in a short period of time;
     *The short-term goal is to achieve a 1,000% increase in the issue price within two weeks and a 1,000-fold increase within three months;
     *The long-term goal is to achieve a value increase of more than 10,000 times within a year, let us look forward to it together.

     *Automatically burn 12% per transaction
     *5% of which is destroyed
     *5% dividend for holding tokens
     *The 2% tax collected by the project party will be used for community development
