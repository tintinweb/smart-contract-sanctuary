 * Winkies is the ERC20 token for the Winki platform. It is received and

 *
 * It should act as a standard ERC20, along with some niceties (read below).
 *
 * Accounts have the ability to sign off-chain "proofs" that can be used by other
 * accounts to do the equivalent of a `transferFrom` operation. This is mostly used
 * for granting coins to presale investors. Indeed, this avoids us having to create
 * hundreds of transactions or deploy a heavy contract just to do so. Instead, people
 * will be able to fetch their "proof of claim" and submit it against the contract to
 * retrieve their coins.
 * A proof of claim is composed of:
 * - the source and destination accounts.
 * - the amount of coins involved.
 * - a block after which it can be executed, if the proof is submitted too early it should
 *   be rejected.
 * - a nonce used to avoid replay attacks, if the nonce was already seen for the same source
 *   account the proof should be discarded.
