// Solve The Riddle (STR) is a degenerative, burnable, and charitable NFT collection of 10000 tokens.

// There are four crypto related riddles to solve, any token can claim any riddle.
// The riddles are activated by total token mints, and the previous riddle being solved:

// Riddle 1 will be activated after 2500 token mints.
// Riddle 2 will be activated after riddle 1 is solved and their have been 5000 token mints.
// Riddle 3 will be activated after riddle 2 is solved and their have been 7500 token mints.
// Riddle 4 will be activated after riddle 3 is solved and their have been 10000 token mints.

// Each riddle pool contains 0.04 BNB units of every none burnt token, and 0.01 BNB of every burnt token within its range (2500).
// For example token 100 contributes 0.04 of its mint price to the riddle 1 pool, but token 5200 contributes to the riddle 3 pool.
// Each riddle pool will contain a minimum of 25 BNB and a maximum of 100 BNB.

// The first token owner to solve the active riddle (and submit it to the blockchain) is rewarded with the riddle pool, and the next riddle becomes active.

// Each token minted will be assigned a random number of attempts between 1 and 10 it can use solve a riddle.
// Every incorrect attempt reduces the available attempts, until finally on the last attempt the token is burnt.
// Each token has an image, which includes the riddle, and a hint, as the attempts reduce, the image slowly fades away.

// Tokens can be minted at a rate of 10 tokens per transaction, at 0.06 BNB per token.
// 0.04 BNB goes to the riddle pool, 0.01 BNB to the charity address, and 0.01 BNB to the developers.

// Tokens can be burnt voluntarily, doing so will refund 0.03 BNB from the riddle pool to your wallet, leaving 0.01 in the riddle pool.
// Think of this as a 50% refund for your inability to solve the riddles.

// TOKENS CAN ONLY BE BURNT WHEN THEIR RIDDLE MINT BLOCK IS YET TO BE SOLVED.
// Eg: Token 500 can only be burnt before riddle 1 is solved, token 2501 can only be burnt before riddle 2 is solved, etc.

// FAQ

// Wen website?
// The riddler needs no website, those who understand the contract will be at a distinct advantage.

// Wen discord?
// The riddler needs no discord, no whitelist, no meme contests, it is in token holders best interests to spread the word.

// Wen utility?
// The utility of the riddler is to provide you the opportunity to solve the riddles, and take the riddle pool.
// It is feature complete, no roadmap, no partnerships, no new jpegs.

// How do i mint the tokens? or submit a riddle answer?
// Those who understand the contract will be at a distinct advantage.

// Where do i find the token image?
// Those who understand the contract will be at a distinct advantage.

// How do i know which riddle is active?
// Ok, this we will give away (sort of). There is a contract method called `stats`, you should be able to work it out from there.

// Charitable?
// Yes a small portion of each mint goes to a non profit focussing on sensible crypto regulation, specifically https://www.coincenter.org/donate/
// feel free to double check the address before minting.
// NOTE: The organisation documents ethereum for donations, as you should know they can also use this same address to withdraw BNB should they choose to.

// Is this safe?
// The contract source code is verified, and useful to read in solving the riddles, there are no contract owner controlled methods (the dev cant rug).
// Only a token holder with the correct riddle answer can receive the riddle pools, and only after the required number of tokens have been minted.
// Technically we knows the answers to the riddles, however we don't control the blockchain, the first correct transaction takes the pool, we don't intend to purchase any of the tokens,
// we could not control who wins even if we did.
// Please DYOR and consult a developer before minting.
