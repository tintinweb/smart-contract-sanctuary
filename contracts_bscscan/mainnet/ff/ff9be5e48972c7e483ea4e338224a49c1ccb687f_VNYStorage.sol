// The VNYMarketplace Smart Contract
// This is an All-in-One smart contract, which handles all the functionality, minting, payments and decentralised
// storage of the Vanity Marketplace.

// Payments: this smart contract manages all the payments made in the VNYMarketplace, with an hybrid payment method
//  based on $VNY + BNB. 100% of the $VNY used in the purchases are burned.
//  BNB are divided as following: 30% (15% buyback token) used to deposit LP Pair VNY/BNB. 30% buyback the token and stores
//  $VNY to distribute the Royaly Rewards, 20% is stored in BNB from the Hydra to buyback and burn $VNY, 20% is sent to
//  0xDEAD1337.. (dev wallet) as project revenue. A constant buy pressure is applied.

// Storage: each payments triggers a record to be stored in the smart contract, decentralised database where NFTs, UnWrapped
//  addresses and payments are saved.

// NFT: the Wrapped NFTs are purchased and created as ERC-721 Tokens, each defined by an ID. The token does not have a network
//  chosen already, but it will be in case of UnWrapping. Each NFT are awarded by the Royalty System, where each mint of the
//  same needle gives rewards in $VNY to the previous minters, distrubuted in percentage based on the ranking
//  (ex. 1st Minter gets higher Rewards). The onwer of the NFT is elegible to UnWrap the NFT, burning it and requesting the
//  generation.

// The Hydra: this is the Buyback and Burn function of Vanity. When the Hydra decide to strike, BNB stored by this creature
//  are used to Buy Vanity, increasing the price, and immediatly burning the tokens, decreasing the circulating supply.

 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.

 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
