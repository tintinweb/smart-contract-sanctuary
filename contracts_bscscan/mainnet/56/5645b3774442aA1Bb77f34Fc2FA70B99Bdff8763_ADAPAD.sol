 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's uintXX casting operators with added overflow

 *
 * Downcasting from uint256 in Solidity does not revert on overflow. This can
 * easily result in undesired exploitation or bugs, since developers usually
 * assume that overflows raise errors. `SafeCast` restores this intuition by
 * reverting the transaction when such an operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
 *
 * Can be combined with {SafeMath} to extend it to smaller types, by performing
 * all math on `uint256` and then downcasting.
