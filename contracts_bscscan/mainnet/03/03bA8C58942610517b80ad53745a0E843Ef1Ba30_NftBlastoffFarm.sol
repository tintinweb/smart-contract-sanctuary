    Blastoff Finance Deflaionary and Auto redistributing BEP20 Platform Token

    The blasoff token burns x%, distributes x% to hodles, lockes x% as liquidity and reserves x% for NFT holders at every transaction.
    The blastoff ecosystem will involve several Dapp products to: 
    - increase transaction volume of our blastoff token
    - create new ways to earn APY with your blastoff token
    - and much more!
