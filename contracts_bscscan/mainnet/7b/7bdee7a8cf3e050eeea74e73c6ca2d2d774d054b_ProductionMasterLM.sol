        Total user strength (ts) :  ws * as

        cts (cummulative ts) = ts1 +ts2

        ws1 * as1 + ws2*as2 + ws3*as3

        we can present ws as yearlyWeek - (startWeek - 1) , where startIndex = startWeek - 1, as week of calculation beginning or index of array, where 

        yearlyWeek = yearlyRewardIndex + 1, because array of weeks starts from 

        we can present as as 50% * totalUserBalance (cummulative balance of latest vault),
        so

        So, our formula:
        50% * (yearlyWeek(totalUserBalance1 + totalUserBalance2 + ...) - (totalUserBalance1*startIndex1 + totalUserBalance2*startIndex2 + ...))

        totalUserBalance1 + totalUserBalance2 is totalAmount, we can calculate with stake() and exit() functions
        totalUserBalance1*startIndex1 + totalUserBalance2*startIndex2 is totalWeight, we can calculate with stake() and exit functions
