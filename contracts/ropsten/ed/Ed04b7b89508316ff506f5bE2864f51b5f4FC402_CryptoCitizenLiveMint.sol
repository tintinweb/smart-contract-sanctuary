 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed

 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");

 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *

 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
