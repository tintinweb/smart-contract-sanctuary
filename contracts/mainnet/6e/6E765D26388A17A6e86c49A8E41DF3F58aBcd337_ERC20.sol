 Kangal Token Contract

 A real decentralized community token with 100% tokens in starting Uniswap supply and locked away for 10 years, no minting functions.
 Further information on kangaltoken.com
 BTW Kangal really is a cool dog breed, and arguably the strongest.

 Symbol        : KANGAL
 Name          : Kangal
 Total supply  : 100000000000
 Decimals      : 18
 Deployer Account : 0x63c67Ba2aa323e47eddDB3952990CF41768a679c

 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
