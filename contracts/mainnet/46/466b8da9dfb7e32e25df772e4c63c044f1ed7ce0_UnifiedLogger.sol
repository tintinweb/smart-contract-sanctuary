 * @dev Library for managing

 * types.
 *
 * Sets have the following properties:
 *
 * - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time
 * (O(1)).
 * - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
 *
 * ```

 *     // Declare a set state variable

 * }
 * ```
 *
 * As of v3.0.0, only sets of type `address` (`AddressSet`) and `uint256`
 * (`UintSet`) are supported.
