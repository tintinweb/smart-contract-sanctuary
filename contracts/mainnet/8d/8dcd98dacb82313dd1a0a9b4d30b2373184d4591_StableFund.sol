    // 1) The conversion rate adopted is the number of gons that equals 1 fragment.
    //    The inverse rate must not be used--TOTAL_GONS is always the numerator and _totalSupply is
    //    always the denominator. (i.e. If you want to convert gons to fragments instead of
    //    multiplying by the inverse rate, you should divide by the normal rate)
    // 2) Gon balances converted into Fragments are always rounded down (truncated).
    //
    // We make the following guarantees:
    // - If address 'A' transfers x Fragments to address 'B'. A's resulting external balance will
    //   be decreased by precisely x Fragments, and B's external balance will be precisely
    //   increased by x Fragments.

    // We do not guarantee that the sum of all balances equals the result of calling totalSupply().

    // f(x0) + f(x1) + ... + f(xn) is not always equal to f(x0 + x1 + ... xn).
