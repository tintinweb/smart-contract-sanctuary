 * First Edition
 *
 * personalized generative art on the blockchain                  by Joshua Wu
 *
 *
 * Hashrunes are on-chain generative art created by you.
 * A Hashrune's design is based on its unique name. Anyone can mint a Hashrune by naming it and paying a fee.
 *
 * This is the First Edition, made for those in the community who wanted but missed out on summoning a Genesis Hashrune.
 * The design of the First Edition Hashrunes have corner markings to distinguish them from Genesis Hashrunes.
 *
 * The price to mint a First Edition Hashrune starts at 0.05 ETH. For each Hashrune minted, the price will increase by at least 0.0002 ETH.
 * If you own the Genesis version of a Hashrune, you can mint the First Edition version for free. (The price does not increase in this case.)
 *
 * There is a max supply of 10,000 First Edition Hashrunes. Additionally, we are able to decrease the max supply (but not increase it).
 * We are also able to increase the price increment (but not decrease it).
 *
 * Functions specific to Hashrunes:
 *   `mint(string name)`: Mint a Hashrune.
 *   `getName(uint256 tokenId) -> string`: Look up the name corresponding to a token id.
 *   `getTokenId(string name) -> uint256`: Look up the token id corresponding to a name.
 *   `getRune(string name) -> string`: Get the design of a Hashrune.
 *   `getCharacters(string name) -> string`: Get the list of characters used for a Hashrune.
 *   `getColors(string name) -> uint256[]`: Get a Hashrune's RGB24 colors. Each color corresponds to each character in `getCharacters(name)`,
 *                                          with an extra color for the background at the end of the list.

 * First Edition
 *
 * personalized generative art on the blockchain                  by Joshua Wu
 *
 *
 * Hashrunes are on-chain generative art created by you.
 * A Hashrune's design is based on its unique name. Anyone can mint a Hashrune by naming it and paying a fee.
 *
 * This is the First Edition, made for those in the community who wanted but missed out on summoning a Genesis Hashrune.
 * The design of the First Edition Hashrunes have corner markings to distinguish them from Genesis Hashrunes.
 *
 * The price to mint a First Edition Hashrune starts at 0.05 ETH. For each Hashrune minted, the price will increase by at least 0.0002 ETH.
 * If you own the Genesis version of a Hashrune, you can mint the First Edition version for free. (The price does not increase in this case.)
 *
 * There is a max supply of 10,000 First Edition Hashrunes. Additionally, we are able to decrease the max supply (but not increase it).
 * We are also able to increase the price increment (but not decrease it).
 *
 * Functions specific to Hashrunes:
 *   `mint(string name)`: Mint a Hashrune.
 *   `getName(uint256 tokenId) -> string`: Look up the name corresponding to a token id.
 *   `getTokenId(string name) -> uint256`: Look up the token id corresponding to a name.
 *   `getRune(string name) -> string`: Get the design of a Hashrune.
 *   `getCharacters(string name) -> string`: Get the list of characters used for a Hashrune.
 *   `getColors(string name) -> uint256[]`: Get a Hashrune's RGB24 colors. Each color corresponds to each character in `getCharacters(name)`,
 *                                          with an extra color for the background at the end of the list.
