IN THE GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY…
…a balance between light and dark side of the force was disturbed with a sudden arrival of Clash Of Stars Emperor. A hope for a new order in the decentralized galaxy is finally here, allowing jedi investors to join this movement. The emerging Clash Of Stars Empire is here for you to reach the stars and become the most powerful cryptocurrency in the entire Universe.
Take your lightsabers (ETHs), laser guns (BNBs) and join the dark side of the Force. Be a part of the new empire, the millions of $GALAXY are now at your lightsabers’ tip.
The new order
◦ The grace of the Clash Of Stars Emperor – each empire member has the same chance to seek for the dark side of the force since the beginning (fair launch).

◦ From the trooper to the dark lord – weak hands will be sacrificed and rewarded to Empire’s holders with each sell.

◦ Galactic invasion – an army of shilltroopers will be deployed to every planet of the Galaxy to proclaim the strength of the Clash Of Stars Empire.

GAMEPLAY

1.Freedom: You can explore any part of the universe, customize any spaceship and play any role you want-trader, adventurer, space pirate or galaxy conqueror!

 2.Balance: Build a fleet with 30 different spaceships of various types from destroyer, cruiser, battleship to aircraft carrier. Each spaceship has its own special weapon and skills. How to balance your spaceships and optimize your fleet to win-the decision is up to you!

3.Interactivity: In this game you can play with other real players around the world and enjoy each exciting moment-reinforcing your allies, intercepting enemies or trade fleet, defending your space station from invaders, assembling to attack a big boss and even challenging thousands of cross-server top players in real time.

FEATURES
ENJOY VARIOUS REAL-TIME STAR WARS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS


SPACESHIP
UNLOCK OVER 30 SPACESHIPS AND 60 SPECIAL-DESIGNED WEAPONS


DESTROYER
Kestrel

UAV Anti-aircraft Guns
 
UAV Vulnerability Analysis
Good at intercepting missiles and dodging quickly. It has a slight edge over other ships in fighting against UAV and battleship. It can shoot multiple targets within firing range.


CRUISER
Wolf
Nuclear Decay Bomb
Fire-Control Jamming Bomb


With 100% hit rate and middle-and-long range fighting capacity, it has a slight edge over other ships in fighting against destroyer. It can shoot a missile at the target and make sustained damage on it.


BATTLESHIP
Hippo
Magnetic Jammer
Destroy Ammo

With heavy firing system, it can deal great damage on the lead ship of aircraft carrier and building but can’t hit UAVs and destroyer. It shoots jamming bomb to the targets within range and makes them attack randomly.


AIRCRAFT CARRIER
Sea Snake

Hyperspace Projection
Energy Shield

There are many UAVs to escort it. Once these UAVs are destroyed, it cannot fight any more. It can produce a projection of lead ship and UAVs to draw the enemies’ fire.


SPECIAL SHIP
Empire

Fire-control Jammer
Antimatter Shield
Fire Control Radar Jammer

It interferes with the enemies’ weapon system and makes their weapons unable to shoot in a short time.



SPECIAL SHIP
Wrath

Demolisher Bomb
Armor Stabilizer
Engine Overload

Good at long-range fighting. It can launch a bombshell on the target area and cause widespread damage after explosion.
