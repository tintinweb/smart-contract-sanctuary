     * @dev General Description:
     *     Determine a value of precision.
     *     Calculate an integer approximation of (_baseN / _baseD) ^ (_expN / _expD) * 2 ^ precision.
     *     Return the result along with the precision used.
     *
     * Detailed Description:
     *     Instead of calculating "base ^ exp", we calculate "e ^ (log(base) * exp)".
     *     The value of "log(base)" is represented with an integer slightly smaller than "log(base) * 2 ^ precision".
     *     The larger "precision" is, the more accurately this value represents the real value.
     *     However, the larger "precision" is, the more bits are required in order to store this value.
     *     And the exponentiation function, which takes "x" and calculates "e ^ x", is limited to a maximum exponent (maximum value of "x").
     *     This maximum exponent depends on the "precision" used, and it is given by "maxExpArray[precision] >> (MAX_PRECISION - precision)".
     *     Hence we need to determine the highest precision which can be used for the given input, before calling the exponentiation function.
     *     This allows us to compute "base ^ exp" with maximum accuracy and without exceeding 256 bits in any of the intermediate computations.
     *     This functions assumes that "_expN < 2 ^ 256 / log(MAX_NUM - 1)", otherwise the multiplication should be replaced with a "safeMul".
     *     Since we rely on unsigned-integer arithmetic and "base < 1" ==> "log(base) < 0", this function does not support "_baseN < _baseD".
