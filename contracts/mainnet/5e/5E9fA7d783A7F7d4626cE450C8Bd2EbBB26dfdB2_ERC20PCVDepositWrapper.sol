/**
  @notice a lightweight contract to wrap ERC20 holding PCV contracts
  @author Fei Protocol
  When upgrading the PCVDeposit interface, there are many old contracts which do not support it.
  The main use case for the new interface is to add read methods for the Collateralization Oracle.
  Most PCVDeposits resistant balance method is simply returning the balance as a pass-through
  If the PCVDeposit holds FEI it may be considered as protocol FEI

  This wrapper can be used in the CR oracle which reduces the number of contract upgrades and reduces the complexity and risk of the upgrade
