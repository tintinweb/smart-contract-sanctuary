 * will be able to fetch their "proof of claim" and submit it against the contract to
 * retrieve their coins.
 * A proof of claim is composed of:
 * - the source and destination accounts.
 * - the amount of coins involved.
 * - a block after which it can be executed, if the proof is submitted too early it should
 *   be rejected.
 * - a nonce used to avoid replay attacks, if the nonce was already seen for the same source
