    🧠 ORACLE COIN - $ORA 🧠
    
    Telegram : https://t.me/ORAoraclecoin
    
    Oracle Coin allows individuals, groups, and businesses to exchange ideas for other assets on a secure and decentralized blockchain platform. 
   
    In recent years, non-fungible tokens (NTFs) have become an increasingly popular manner of buying and selling digital artworks; however, digital art is only a fraction of the potential applications that NTFs bring to this new world. 
   
    Our platform, we argue, will be the blockchain implementation that fully focuses on the specific needs of people with potentially big ideas. 
   
    Moreover, it will be a bridge between these people and those who are in search of new ideas to invest in. 
   
    We believe that this key distinction will allow us to fill in one of the many gaps that can be found in the blockchain industry.

    Our idea started by looking at the many success stories involving NFTs when we realized that it is not only digital art that can be created and bought as NFTs but ideas can be used in the same way a well. 
    
    With this in mind, we expect that our product will facilitate the interaction of two types of people, very creative people and people who are looking for new ideas whether for their existing business, a new venture, or personal reasons.
