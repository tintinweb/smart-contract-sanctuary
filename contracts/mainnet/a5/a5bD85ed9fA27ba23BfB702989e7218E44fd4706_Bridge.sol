 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
 * @title Bridge
 * @notice This contract is responsible for cross-asset swaps using the Synthetix protocol as the bridging exchange.
 * There are three types of supported cross-asset swaps, tokenToSynth, synthToToken, and tokenToToken.
 *
 * 1) tokenToSynth
 * Swaps a supported token in a saddle pool to any synthetic asset (e.g. tBTC -> sAAVE).
 *
 * 2) synthToToken
 * Swaps any synthetic asset to a suported token in a saddle pool (e.g. sDEFI -> USDC).
 *
 * 3) tokenToToken
 * Swaps a supported token in a saddle pool to one in another pool (e.g. renBTC -> DAI).
 *
 * Due to the settlement periods of synthetic assets, the users must wait until the trades can be completed.
 * Users will receive an ERC721 token that represents pending cross-asset swap. Once the waiting period is over,
 * the trades can be settled and completed by calling the `completeToSynth` or the `completeToToken` function.
 * In the cases of pending `synthToToken` or `tokenToToken` swaps, the owners of the pending swaps can also choose
 * to withdraw the bridging synthetic assets instead of completing the swap.
