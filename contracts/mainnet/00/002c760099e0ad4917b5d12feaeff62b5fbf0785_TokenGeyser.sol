 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result

 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an

 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

/**
 * @title Token Geyser
 * @dev A smart-contract based mechanism to distribute tokens over time, inspired loosely by
 *      Compound and Uniswap.
 *
 *      Distribution tokens are added to a locked pool in the contract and become unlocked over time
 *      according to a once-configurable unlock schedule. Once unlocked, they are available to be
 *      claimed by users.
 *
 *      A user may deposit tokens to accrue ownership share over the unlocked pool. This owner share
 *      is a function of the number of tokens deposited as well as the length of time deposited.
 *      Specifically, a user's share of the currently-unlocked pool equals their "deposit-seconds"
 *      divided by the global "deposit-seconds". This aligns the new token distribution with long
 *      term supporters of the project, addressing one of the major drawbacks of simple airdrops.
 *
 *      More background and motivation available at:
 *      https://github.com/ampleforth/RFCs/blob/master/RFCs/rfc-1.md
