// Original work from Compound: https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Governance/GovernorAlpha.sol
// Modified to work in the YAM system

// all votes work on underlying _yuanBalances[address], not balanceOf(address)

// Original audit: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-alpha-governance-system-audit/
// Overview:
//    No Critical
//    High:
//      Issue:
//        Approved proposal may be impossible to queue, cancel or execute
//        Fixed with `proposalMaxOperations`
//      Issue:
//        Queued proposal with repeated actions cannot be executed
//        Fixed by explicitly disallow proposals with repeated actions to be queued in the Timelock contract.
//
// Changes made by YAM after audit:
//    Formatting, naming, & uint256 instead of uint
//    Since YAM supply changes, updated quorum & proposal requirements
//    If any uint96, changed to uint256 to match YAM as opposed to comp

/**
 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow
 * checks.
 *
 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result
 * in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an
 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
