 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow
 * checks.
 *
 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result
 * in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an
 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.

 *
 *      uFragment balances are internally represented with a hidden denomination, 'gons'.

    // order to minimize this risk, we adhere to the following guidelines:
    // 1) The conversion rate adopted is the number of gons that equals 1 fragment.
    //    The inverse rate must not be used--TOTAL_GONS is always the numerator and _totalSupply is
    //    always the denominator. (i.e. If you want to convert gons to fragments instead of
    //    multiplying by the inverse rate, you should divide by the normal rate)
    // 2) Gon balances converted into Fragments are always rounded down (truncated).
    //
    // We make the following guarantees:
    // - If address 'A' transfers x Fragments to address 'B'. A's resulting external balance will
    //   be decreased by precisely x Fragments, and B's external balance will be precisely
    //   increased by x Fragments.
    //
    // We do not guarantee that the sum of all balances equals the result of calling totalSupply().

    // f(x0) + f(x1) + ... + f(xn) is not always equal to f(x0 + x1 + ... xn).
