  // Particle Terminology
  //
  //   Particle               - Non-fungible Token (NFT)
  //   Mass                   - Underlying Asset of a Token (ex; DAI)
  //   Charge                 - Accrued Interest on the Underlying Asset of a Token
  //   Charged Particle       - Any NFT that has a Mass and a Positive Charge
  //   Neutral Particle       - Any NFT that has a Mass and No Charge
  //   Energize / Recharge    - Deposit of an Underlying Asset into an NFT
  //   Discharge              - Withdraw the Accrued Interest of an NFT leaving the Particle with its initial Mass
  //   Release                - Withdraw the Underlying Asset & Accrued Interest of an NFT leaving the Particle with No Mass or Charge
  //
  //   Proton                 - NFTs minted from the Charged Particle Accelerator
  //                            - A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol p or p⁺, with a positive electric charge of +1e elementary
  //                              charge and a mass slightly less than that of a neutron.
  //   WBoson                 - Membership Classification
  //                            - The wBoson is a type of elementary particle. It is the quantum of the electromagnetic field including
  //                              electromagnetic radiation such as light and radio waves, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force.
  //                              WBosons are massless, so they always move at the speed of light in vacuum.
  //   Photon                    - Platform Governance Token
  //                            - A charged subatomic particle. An atom or group of atoms that carries a positive or negative electric charge
  //                              as a result of having lost or gained one or more electrons.
