    Conversion path is a data structure that&#39;s used when converting a token to another token in the bancor network
    when the conversion cannot necessarily be done by single converter and might require multiple &#39;hops&#39;.
    The path defines which converters should be used and what kind of conversion should be done in each step.

    The path format doesn&#39;t include complex structure and instead, it is represented by a single array
    in which each &#39;hop&#39; is represented by a 2-tuple - smart token & to token.
    In addition, the first element is always the source token.
    The smart token is only used as a pointer to a converter (since converter addresses are more likely to change).

    Format:
    [source token, smart token, to token, smart token, to token...]
