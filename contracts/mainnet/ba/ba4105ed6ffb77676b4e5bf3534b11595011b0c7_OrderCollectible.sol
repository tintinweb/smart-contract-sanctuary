        We need rounded up logarithm of number n with base 256 , in formula presentation: roof(log(256,n))
        Example: roof(log(256,0x414244))=|in decimal 0x414244=4276804|=roof(log(256,4276804))~=roof(2.4089)=3;
        Encoding Base58 works with numbers in base 58.
        Example: 0x414244 = 21 53 20 0 = 21*58^3 + 53*58^2 + 20*58+0
        How many digits are needed to write such a number n in base 58?
        We need rounded up logarithm of number n with base 58 , in formula presentation: roof(log(58,n))
        Example: roof(log(58,0x414244))=|in decimal 0x414244=4276804|=roof(log(58,4276804))~=roof(3.7603)=4;
        
        And the question is: How many times the number in base 58 will be bigger than number in base 256 represantation?
        The aswer is lim n->inf log(58,n)/log(256,n)
        
        lim n->inf log(58,n)/log(256,n)=[inf/inf]=|use hopitals rule|=(1/(n*ln(58))/(1/(n*ln(256))=
        =ln(256)/ln(58)=log(58,256)~=1.36
        
        So, log(58,n)~=1.36 * log(256,n); (1)
        
        Therefore, we know the asymptoyic minimal size of additional memory of digits array, that shoud be used.
        But calculated limit is asymptotic value. So it may be some errors like the size of n in base 58 is bigger than calculated value.
        Hence, (1) will be rewrited as: log(58,n) = [log(256,n) * 136/100] + 1; (2)
        ,where square brackets [a] is valuable part of number [a] 
        In code exist @param digitlength which dinamically calculates the explicit size of digits array.
        And there are correct statement that digitlength <= [log(256,n) * 136/100] + 1 .
