 *
 * Selling:
 *   1. Deploy `TokenizedProperty`. Initially all tokens and ownership of this property will be assigned to the &#39;deployer&#39;
 *   2. Deploy `ShareholderDAO` and transfer the property&#39;s (1) ownership to it
 *   3. Configure and deploy a `TokenSale`
 *     - After completing (1, 2, 3) blockimmo will verify the property as legitimate in `LandRegistry`
 *     - blockimmo will then authorize `this` to the `Whitelist` before seller can proceed to (4)
 *   4. Transfer tokens of `TokenizedProperty` (1) to be sold to `this` (3)
 *   5. Investors are able to buy tokens while the sale is open. &#39;Deployer&#39; calls `finalize` to complete the sale
 *
 * Note: blockimmo will be responsible for managing initial sales on our platform. This means we will be configuring
 *       and deploying all contracts for sellers. This provides an extra layer of control/security until we&#39;ve refined
 *       these processes and proven them in the real-world.
 *       Later sales will use SplitPayment contracts to route funds, with examples in the tests.
 *
 * Unsold tokens (of a successful sale) are redistributed proportionally to investors via Airdrop, as described in:
 * https://medium.com/FundFantasy/airdropping-vs-burning-part-1-613a9c6ebf1c
 *
 * If a sale&#39;s soft-cap is not reached (and the seller does not `accept` a lower price), investors will be refunded Ether and the seller refunded tokens.
 *
 * For stable token sales (soft and hard-cap in USD instead of Wei), we rely on MakerDAO&#39;s on-chain ETH/USD conversion rate
 * https://developer.makerdao.com/feeds/
 * This approach to mitigating Ether volatility seems to best when analyzing trade-offs, short of selling directly in FIAT.
