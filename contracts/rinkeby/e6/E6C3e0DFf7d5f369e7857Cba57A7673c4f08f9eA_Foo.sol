Let's say Alice can see the code of Foo and Bar but not Mal.
It is obvious to Alice that Foo.callBar() executes the code inside Bar.log().
However Eve deploys Foo with the address of Mal, so that calling Foo.callBar()
will actually execute the code at Mal.

1. Eve deploys Mal
2. Eve deploys Foo with the address of Mal
3. Alice calls Foo.callBar() after reading the code and judging that it is
