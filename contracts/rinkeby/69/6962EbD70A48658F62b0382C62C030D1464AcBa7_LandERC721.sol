/**
 * @title Land ERC721
 *
 * @notice Land ERC721 (a.k.a Land Plot, Land, or Land NFT) represents land plots in Illuvium: Zero (IZ).
 *      Each token is a piece of land (land plot) on the overall world map in IZ.
 *
 * @notice Land plot is uniquely identified by its region and coordinates (x, y) within the region.
 *      There can be only one plot with the given coordinates (x, y) in a given region.
 *
 * @notice Land plot has internal coordinate system used to place the structures (off-chain).
 *      Land plot may contain "sites" with the resources,
 *      a Landmark, increasing the resource production / decreasing resource losses,
 *      or a special type of Landmark - Arena, used to host tournaments.
 *      Sites are positioned on the plot and have their own coordinates (x, y) within a plot.
 *      Number of sites depends on the land plot rarity (tier).
 *      Landmark may exist only in the rare land plots (tier 3 or higher) and resides in the center of the plot.
 *
 * @notice Land plot does not contain details on the structures, these details are stored off-chain.
 *      The fundamental value of the Land is always drawn from the underlying Land NFT,
 *      which produces Fuel in the form of an ERC20 tokens.
 *
 * @notice Land plot metadata is immutable and includes (see `LandView` structure):
 *      - Region ID (1 - 7), determines which tileset to use in game,
 *      - Coordinates (x, y) on the overall world map, indicating which grid position the land sits in,
 *      - Tier ID (1 - 5), the rarity of the land, tier is used to create the list of sites,
 *      - Plot Size, defines an internal coordinate system within a plot,
 *      - Internal Land Structure
 *        - enumeration of sites, each site metadata including:
 *          - Type ID (1 - 6), defining the type of the site:
 *            1) Carbon,
 *            2) Silicon,
 *            3) Hydrogen,
 *            4) Crypton,
 *            5) Hyperion,
 *            6) Solon
 *          - Coordinates (x, y) on the land plot
 *        - Landmark Type ID:
 *            0) no Landmark,
 *            1) Carbon Landmark,
 *            2) Silicon Landmark,
 *            3) Hydrogen Landmark (Eternal Spring),
 *            4) Crypton Landmark,
 *            5) Hyperion Landmark,
 *            6) Solon Landmark (Fallen Star),
 *            7) Arena
 *
 * @notice Region ID, Coordinates (x, y), Tier ID, and Plot Size are stored as is, while Internal Land Structure
 *      is derived from Tier ID, Plot Size, and a Seed (see `LandStore` structure)
 *
 * @notice A note on Region, Coordinates (x, y), Tier, Plot Size, and Internal Land Structure.
 *      Land Plot smart contract stores Region, Coordinates (x, y), Tier, Plot Size, and Internal Land Structure
 *      as part of the land metadata on-chain, however the use of these values within the smart contract is limited.
 *      Effectively that means that helper smart contracts, backend, or frontend applications can, to some extent,
 *      treat these values at their own decision, may redefine, enrich, or ignore their meaning.
 *
 * @notice Land NFTs are minted by the trusted helper smart contract(s) (see `LandSale`), which are responsible
 *      for supplying the correct metadata.
 *      Land NFT contract itself doesn't store the Merkle root of the valid land metadata, and
 *      has a limited constraint validation for NFTs it mints/tracks, it guarantees:
 *         - (regionId, x, y) uniqueness
 *         - non-intersection of the sites coordinates within a plot
 *         - correspondence of the number of resource sites and their types to the land tier
 *         - correspondence of the landmark type to the land tier
 *
 * @dev Minting a token requires its metadata to be supplied before or during the minting process;
 *      Burning the token destroys its metadata;
 *      Metadata can be pre-allocated: it can be set/updated/removed for non-existing tokens, and
 *      once the token is minted, its metadata becomes "frozen" - immutable, it cannot be changed or removed.
 *
 * @notice Refer to "Illuvium: Zero" design documents for additional information about the game.
 *      Refer to "Illuvium Land Sale On-chain Architecture" for additional information about
 *      the technical design of the Land ERC721 token and Land Sale smart contracts and their interaction.

/**
 * @title Upgradeable Access Control List // ERC1967Proxy
 *
 * @notice Access control smart contract provides an API to check
 *      if a specific operation is permitted globally and/or
 *      if a particular user has a permission to execute it.
 *
 * @notice It deals with two main entities: features and roles.
 *
 * @notice Features are designed to be used to enable/disable public functions
 *      of the smart contract (used by a wide audience).
 * @notice User roles are designed to control the access to restricted functions
 *      of the smart contract (used by a limited set of maintainers).
 *
 * @notice Terms "role", "permissions" and "set of permissions" have equal meaning
 *      in the documentation text and may be used interchangeably.
 * @notice Terms "permission", "single permission" implies only one permission bit set.
 *
 * @notice Access manager is a special role which allows to grant/revoke other roles.
 *      Access managers can only grant/revoke permissions which they have themselves.
 *      As an example, access manager with no other roles set can only grant/revoke its own
 *      access manager permission and nothing else.
 *
 * @notice Access manager permission should be treated carefully, as a super admin permission:
 *      Access manager with even no other permission can interfere with another account by
 *      granting own access manager permission to it and effectively creating more powerful
 *      permission set than its own.
 *
 * @dev Both current and OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementations feature a similar API
 *      to check/know "who is allowed to do this thing".
 * @dev Zeppelin implementation is more flexible:
 *      - it allows setting unlimited number of roles, while current is limited to 256 different roles
 *      - it allows setting an admin for each role, while current allows having only one global admin
 * @dev Current implementation is more lightweight:
 *      - it uses only 1 bit per role, while Zeppelin uses 256 bits
 *      - it allows setting up to 256 roles at once, in a single transaction, while Zeppelin allows
 *        setting only one role in a single transaction
 *
 * @dev This smart contract is designed to be inherited by other
 *      smart contracts which require access control management capabilities.
 *
 * @dev Access manager permission has a bit 255 set.
 *      This bit must not be used by inheriting contracts for any other permissions/features.
 *
 * @dev This is an upgradeable version of the ACL, based on Zeppelin implementation for ERC1967,
 *      see https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable

	 * @notice Determines the permission bitmask an operator can set on the

	 * @notice Used to calculate the permission bitmask to be set when requested
	 *     in `updateRole` and `updateFeatures` functions
	 *
	 * @dev Calculated based on:
	 *      1) operator's own permission set read from userRoles[operator]
	 *      2) target permission set - what is already set on the target
	 *      3) desired permission set - what do we want set target to
	 *
	 * @dev Corner cases:
	 *      1) Operator is super admin and its permission set is `FULL_PRIVILEGES_MASK`:
	 *        `desired` bitset is returned regardless of the `target` permission set value
	 *        (what operator sets is what they get)
	 *      2) Operator with no permissions (zero bitset):
	 *        `target` bitset is returned regardless of the `desired` value
	 *        (operator has no authority and cannot modify anything)
	 *
	 * @dev Example:
	 *      Consider an operator with the permissions bitmask     00001111
	 *      is about to modify the target permission set          01010101
	 *      Operator wants to set that permission set to          00110011
	 *      Based on their role, an operator has the permissions
	 *      to update only lowest 4 bits on the target, meaning that
	 *      high 4 bits of the target set in this example is left
	 *      unchanged and low 4 bits get changed as desired:      01010011
	 *
	 * @param operator address of the contract operator which is about to set the permissions
	 * @param target input set of permissions to operator is going to modify
	 * @param desired desired set of permissions operator would like to set
	 * @return resulting set of permissions given operator will set
