     * liquidate the loan and seize the underlying collateral NFT.
     * - maxLoanDuration: The maximum amount of time (measured in seconds) that can elapse before the lender can
     * liquidate the loan and seize the underlying collateral NFT.
     * - maxInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints: This is maximum the interest rate (measured in basis points, e.g.
