/**
 * @title Tiny ERC721
 *
 * @notice Tiny ERC721 defines an NFT with a very small (up to 32 bits) ID space.
 *      ERC721 enumeration support requires additional writes to the storage:
 *      - when transferring a token in order to update the NFT collections of
 *        the previous and next owners,
 *      - when minting/burning a token in order to update global NFT collection
 *
 * @notice Reducing NFT ID space to 32 bits allows
 *      - to eliminate the need to have and to write to two additional storage mappings
 *        (also achievable with the 48 bits ID space)
 *      - for batch minting optimization by writing 8 tokens instead of 5 at once into
 *        global/local collections
 *
 * @notice This smart contract is designed to be inherited by concrete implementations,
 *      which are expected to define token metadata, auxiliary functions to access the metadata,
 *      and explicitly define token minting interface, which should be built on top
 *      of current smart contract internal interface
 *
 * @notice Fully ERC721-compatible with all optional interfaces implemented (metadata, enumeration),
 *      see https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721

 *        https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/test/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.test.js
 *
 * @dev A note on token URI: there are major differences on how token URI behaves comparing to Zeppelin impl:
 *      1. A token URI can be set for non-existing token for pre-allocation purposes,
 *         still the URI will be deleted once token is burnt
 *      2. If token URI is set, base URI has no affect on the token URI, the two are not concatenated,
 *         base URI is used to construct the token URI only if the latter was not explicitly set
 *
 * @dev Supports EIP-712 powered permits - permit() - approve() with signature.
 *      Supports EIP-712 powered operator permits - permitForAll() - setApprovalForAll() with signature.
 *
 * @dev EIP712 Domain:

/**
 * @title Access Control List
 *
 * @notice Access control smart contract provides an API to check
 *      if specific operation is permitted globally and/or
 *      if particular user has a permission to execute it.
 *
 * @notice It deals with two main entities: features and roles.
 *
 * @notice Features are designed to be used to enable/disable specific
 *      functions (public functions) of the smart contract for everyone.
 * @notice User roles are designed to restrict access to specific
 *      functions (restricted functions) of the smart contract to some users.
 *
 * @notice Terms "role", "permissions" and "set of permissions" have equal meaning
 *      in the documentation text and may be used interchangeably.
 * @notice Terms "permission", "single permission" implies only one permission bit set.
 *
 * @notice Access manager is a special role which allows to grant/revoke other roles.
 *      Access managers can only grant/revoke permissions which they have themselves.
 *      As an example, access manager with no other roles set can only grant/revoke its own
 *      access manager permission and nothing else.
 *
 * @notice Access manager permission should be treated carefully, as a super admin permission:
 *      Access manager with even no other permission can interfere with another account by
 *      granting own access manager permission to it and effectively creating more powerful
 *      permission set than its own.
 *
 * @dev Both current and OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementations feature a similar API
 *      to check/know "who is allowed to do this thing".
 * @dev Zeppelin implementation is more flexible:
 *      - it allows setting unlimited number of roles, while current is limited to 256 different roles
 *      - it allows setting an admin for each role, while current allows having only one global admin
 * @dev Current implementation is more lightweight:
 *      - it uses only 1 bit per role, while Zeppelin uses 256 bits
 *      - it allows setting up to 256 roles at once, in a single transaction, while Zeppelin allows
 *        setting only one role in a single transaction
 *
 * @dev This smart contract is designed to be inherited by other
 *      smart contracts which require access control management capabilities.
 *
 * @dev Access manager permission has a bit 255 set.
 *      This bit must not be used by inheriting contracts for any other permissions/features.
