/**
 * @dev Implementation of https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
 *  [ERC721] Non-Fungible Token Standard
 *
 *  This implmentation of ERC721 assumes sequencial token creation to provide
 *  efficient minting.  Storage for balance are no longer required reducing
 *  gas significantly.  This comes at the price of calculating the balance by
 *  iterating through the entire array.  The balanceOf function should NOT
 *  be used inside a contract.  Gas usage will explode as the size of tokens
 *  increase.  A convineiance function is provided which returns the entire
 *  list of owners whose index maps tokenIds to thier owners.  Zero addresses
 *  indicate burned tokens.
