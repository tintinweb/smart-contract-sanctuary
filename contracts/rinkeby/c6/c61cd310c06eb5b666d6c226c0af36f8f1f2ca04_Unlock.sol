/**
 * @title The Unlock contract
 * @author Julien Genestoux (unlock-protocol.com)
 * This smart contract has 3 main roles:
 *  1. Distribute discounts to discount token holders
 *  2. Grant dicount tokens to users making referrals and/or publishers granting discounts.
 *  3. Create & deploy Public Lock contracts.
 * In order to achieve these 3 elements, it keeps track of several things such as
 *  a. Deployed locks addresses and balances of discount tokens granted by each lock.
 *  b. The total network product (sum of all key sales, net of discounts)
 *  c. Total of discounts granted
 *  d. Balances of discount tokens, including 'frozen' tokens (which have been used to claim
 * discounts and cannot be used/transfered for a given period)
 *  e. Growth rate of Network Product
 *  f. Growth rate of Discount tokens supply
 * The smart contract has an owner who only can perform the following
 *  - Upgrades
 *  - Change in golden rules (20% of GDP available in discounts, and supply growth rate is at most
 * 50% of GNP growth rate)
 * NOTE: This smart contract is partially implemented for now until enough Locks are deployed and
 * in the wild.
 * The partial implementation includes the following features:
 *  a. Keeping track of deployed locks
 *  b. Keeping track of GNP
