 * @title Mintable Sale
 *
 * @notice Mintable Sale sales fixed amount of NFTs (tokens) for a fixed price in a fixed period of time;
 *      it can be used in a 10k sale campaign and the smart contract is generic and
 *      can sell any type of mintable NFT (see MintableERC721 interface)
 *
 * @dev Technically, all the "fixed" parameters can be changed on the go after smart contract is deployed
 *      and operational, but this ability is reserved for quick fix-like adjustments, and to provide
 *      an ability to restart and run a similar sale after the previous one ends
 *
 * @dev When buying a token from this smart contract, next token is minted to the recipient
 *
 * @dev Supports functionality to limit amount of tokens that can be minted to each address
 *
 * @dev Deployment and setup:
 *      1. Deploy smart contract, specify smart contract address during the deployment:
 *         - Mintable ER721 deployed instance address
 *      2. Execute `initialize` function and set up the sale parameters;
 *         sale is not active until it's initialized
