 * Orcs of Orakion 
 
A fantasy exodus by alvar368.

Part I: Exodus Origins.

1- Introduction.
There is perhaps no story in recent memory as tragic as that of the Orcs of Orakion, a thriving
civilization whose growth was cut short by terrible forces well outside their control. Maybe
you’ve seen some of them, arriving in small flocks of destitute survivors at human and
dwarven cities, or maybe you’ve seen their more tragic side, in the shape of starved bodies by
the roadway. Be that how it may, it’s impossible to ignore that something has disturbed the
peace in the ancient lands of Orakion. The orcs that have managed to flee speak of
metaphysical prophecies, curses and divine punishments - certainly nothing coherent, as
testimonies contradict each other and make little conventional sense.

2- The Cradle of Civilizations.

The semi-desertic land of Orakion is the subject of much prophetic and religious writing,
especially in texts that come to us from ancient times. While the canyons, dunes and arid
grasslands have been dominated by the orcish tribes for as long as anyone alive today can
remember, it’s important to note that this hasn’t always been the case. Orakion is known as
the cradle of civilizations for a reason, which is that many of today’s most powerful societies
were born there, and eventually displaced for one reason or another.
However, unlike other mythical lands charged with religious and political meaning, there
have been no crusades to retake it, no pilgrimages to visit its ancient wonders, or tales of
returning. This seeming lack of interest towards their origins is, to say the least, extremely
surprising considering the proud nature of many civilizations with their roots in Orakion. The
simple fact that the orcs were able to hold it uncontested for hundreds of years should be
considered a miracle in and of its own.

3- The Primordial Demise.

As with everything, there is an answer for even the most complicated questions. To solve this
puzzle, we’ll have to travel back to the times when the very first civilization was born in the
mythical land of Orakion. Known nowadays as the primordials, this society is little more than
a footnote in the gargantuan tomes of knowledgeable arcanists and historians. They grew to become 
the most powerful empire in the world over the course of a few centuries, mostly
thanks to their incredible arcane prowess which saw them rise above threats that profoundly
oppressed other civilizations, such as dragon incursions and natural disasters.
They became so powerful in fact, that some say they had a direct connection to the gods
themselves, like they could talk to them. Whether this is true or just vestiges of the
primordials’ hubris that lived on to this very day will probably remain unknown, but it
certainly isn’t impossible considering just how proficient they were with magic; this
civilization could make rivers flow backwards, enchant whole islands to float in the sky as if
they were weightless, and teleport entire towns across great distances when convenient.
The reason every kingdom nowadays isn’t a vassal to this supernaturally powerful empire is
that they went extinct. Maybe it’s the nature of all sentient species to overreach when they
achieve levels of power similar to that of the primordials. A collaboration between the
world’s best historians, arcanists, theologists, and archeologists has finally shed some light on
how the downfall of this original civilization is related to not only the exodus of the orcs, but
also that of several races before them.

The primordials created a cursed artifact, a gargantuan arcane cannon capable of syphoning
the energy of the gods, a weapon whose very existence triggered a war between divinity and
mortals. As it’s natural, the gods prevailed over the comparatively fickle and power-drunk
primordials. They cursed the arcane cannon with divine magic of cataclysmic power,
suspecting that they would eventually come to use it in an attempt of replacing them by
absorbing their essence. As fortune would have it, the gods were right, and the might of the
cannon had a very different effect than what the primordials expected.
A wave of dark energy washed over Orakion, turning fertile grasslands into desert,
vaporizing anyone it came into contact with, and placing omens of misfortune all around;
anything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Infrastructure collapsed, armies mutinied, and
civil war took care of the few surviving primordials. The arcane cannon was buried beneath
the sands, consigned to darkness within forgotten ruins with strange markings that spell
catastrophe in ancient language etched on their walls. After centuries, the darkness subsided
and allowed for life to thrive again in Orakion, as if the gods were giving mortals a second
chance.

Ever since, new societies have risen in the desert, and when they become powerful enough,
they can’t resist digging up the vestiges left behind by the primordials and experimenting
with artifacts whose power they are very far from comprehending. New waves of darkness
have washed over Orakion every time, after the new inhabitants of the land accidentally or
purposefully activate the arcane cannon’s magic. This has caused the massive diasporas that
seem to take place every few centuries, and the one we are seeing now with survivors from
the Orcish Tribes of Orakion.

Part II: The Journey.

1- Prelude.

After a major political event known as the Consortium of the Tribes, Orakion’s many orcish
clans established a central council to rule over all of them, paving the way for the orc nation
to gain superior influence and cohesion by ending territorial disputes and focusing the races’
efforts on the building of a more prosperous nation. They followed the path of all
civilizations born in the land of Orakion, of course. They discovered ancient artifacts buried
in the sand that allowed them to perform wondrous magic, and they wondered what else they
could find if they just dug deep enough.
High King Waikar did what any ruler would do when finding a magical structure larger than
anything his civilization ever made - use it. A few members of the central council opposed
triggering the arcane cannon for fear of prophetic curses, but the warnings of history and
prophecy are fickle in comparison to the freedom of the present moment. What happened
after Waikar fiddled with the intricate mechanisms of the primordials was an absolute
catastrophe, as expected. The same dark wave washed over Orakion, thrusting the orcs into
near-extinction, and immediately killing those who were too close at the time.

2- The Orcish Diaspora.

Those that survived the grim shockwave -about a third of the total population before the
disaster- soon became acquainted with the devastating aftermath it leaves behind - infertile
soil, auras of misfortune, psychic energies capable of blasting sanity away, and a plethora of
similar curses. If they wanted to maintain their survivor status, fleeing Orakion was the only
option. The remaining question was how would they do that, as most other races despise the
orcs and would probably kill them on sight. The other option was to cross the Kyrr mountains
to the north and venture into a completely unexplored land.
With both prospects being terrifying, the remaining orcs were deeply divided and
disorganized. Out of the shadows, a charismatic and valiant figure emerged to lead them,
although not everyone agreed with her decision. The daughter of High King Waikar, Thytak,
was one of the few central council members to disagree with her father, and decided to leave
the capital along her most ardent followers, sheltering themselves and anyone who would
listen to their reasons within a hastily build bunker teeming with abjuration runes. Thytak
thought that the best option was crossing the mountain range to the north, because life as
slaves of other races was not a worthy destiny for the proud orcish children of Orakion.
Some agreed, others disagreed, but in the end most were desperate enough to follow her into
the frost. And with the exception of a few groups that decided to travel south to the humansor 
east to the dwarves, they equipped their warmest and sturdiest leather clothes and began
the odyssey that would take them to their new home.

3- Crossing the Kyrr Peaks.

When Thytak, daughter of Waikar, said that the orcs were to cross the Kyrr Peaks, no one
doubted it would be the harshest endeavor they had ever faced - but still much better than
staying behind in the cursed land of Orakion. However, they couldn’t have possibly imagined
just how terrible it would be. Kyrr is the very definition of the word uninhabitable, not only
because of its freezing weather, snowstorms, avalanches and precipices, but also because of
something few ever speak of: the monstrosities that have made it their home.
Frost spiders, horrible beings the size of a barrel, were one of the worst creatures they
encountered. Their poison is cruel like no other, increasing the freezing point of blood,
effectively solidifying their victims’ bodies in a painful process known as sanguine
crystallization. They were not the only species to claim the lives of many orcs, though; zenith
wolves, a winged variant of the common predators, took hundreds of them in their aerial
hunting raids.
After nineteen gruelling months of travel, they managed to leave behind the icy hellscape of
Kyrr, descending into more temperate hills, but still taller than anything the orcs had ever
climbed before the cataclysm, of course. Those hills are known as Death’s Stairway by the
orcs - such is the trauma Kyrr left on them. Only a small fraction of all those who followed
Thytak survived the perilous journey.

4- Arrival at Seamstone.

From the last hills of Death’s Stairway, the twice-surviving Orcs of Orakion could finally
bear witness to their new homeland, a beautiful region they named Seamstone because of its
curious rocky formations that intertwine with patches of moss and grass. Slowly descending,
their bones still chilled from the journey through Kyrr, the orcs made their first huts. Despite
all the loss and suffering, a festive mood washed over Thytak’s host, and hastily collected
fruit and roasted boar were laid out in a feast.
Relative abundance welcomed them into this new land, with readily available fruit, lumber
and wild animals. After most had recovered from the exhaustion of the journey, the orcs
began their quest to scout the land around them, to locate good hunting spots and mark down
the places where valuable resources could be found.
According to folklore, a town only becomes a town when the first inhabitant dies and is
buried by their people - that milestone marks the moment where the settlement is established
not only in the material plane, but also in the spirit realm. Seamstone’s first death arrived
fairly quickly, only three days after they landed down from Death’s Stairway, as a bravewarrior 
named Kural Taikir died after the wounds left by a frost spider proved too much to bear. And as 
the spirit realm became acquainted with the Orcs of Orakion’s new home,something eerie encroached 
their settlement...

Even the dullest of orcs has noticed that something isn’t quite in its place within Seamstone,
not since Kural died. Children are scared of playing outside, and they speak of moving
shadows that observe them from the edges of the region’s many caves. No one knows what
strange powers rule this land, but Thytak and her followers know that they must uncover it
quickly, before they are exiled by the supernatural once again.
