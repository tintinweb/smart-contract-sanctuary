 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed

 *
 * ```

 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
