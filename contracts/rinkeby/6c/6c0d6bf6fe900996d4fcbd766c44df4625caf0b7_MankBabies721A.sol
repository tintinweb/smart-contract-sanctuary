//
// On chain PFP collection of 10k unique profile images with the following properties:
//   - a single Ethereum transaction created everything
//   - all metadata on chain
//   - all images on chain in svg format
//   - all created in the constraints of a single txn without need of any other txns to load additional data
//   - no use of other deployed contracts
//   - all 5000 OnChain Monkey Babies should be unique
//   - there are 7 traits with 171 values (including 3 traits of no hat, no clothes, and no earring)
//   - the traits have distribution and rarities interesting for collecting
//   - everything on chain can be used in other apps and collections in the future
// And did I say, Baby Monkeys?
