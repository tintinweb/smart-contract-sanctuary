 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

 * @dev Contract module that helps prevent reentrant calls to a function.

 * Inheriting from `ReentrancyGuard` will make the {nonReentrant} modifier
 * available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested
 * (reentrant) calls to them.
 *
 * Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as
 * `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making
 * those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry
 * points to them.

 * to protect against it, check out our blog post

/**
  Allows a decentralised presale to take place, and on success creates a uniswap pair and locks liquidity on Unicrypt.
  B_TOKEN, or base token, is the token the presale attempts to raise. (Usally ETH).
  S_TOKEN, or sale token, is the token being sold, which investors buy with the base token.
  If the base currency is set to the WETH9 address, the presale is in ETH.
  Otherwise it is for an ERC20 token - such as DAI, USDC, WBTC etc.
  For the Base token - It is advised to only use tokens such as ETH (WETH), DAI, USDC or tokens that have no rebasing, or complex fee on transfers. 1 token should ideally always be 1 token.
  Token withdrawls are done on a percent of total contribution basis (opposed to via a hardcoded 'amount'). This allows 
  fee on transfer, rebasing, or any magically changing balances to still work for the Sale token.
