 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow

 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result

 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.

 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
