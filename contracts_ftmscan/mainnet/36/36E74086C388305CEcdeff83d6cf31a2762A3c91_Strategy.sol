 *  BaseStrategy implements all of the required functionality to interoperate

 *  abstract methods implemented to adapt the Strategy to the particular needs
 *  it has to create a return.
 *
 *  Of special interest is the relationship between `harvest()` and
 *  `vault.report()'. `harvest()` may be called simply because enough time has
 *  elapsed since the last report, and not because any funds need to be moved
 *  or positions adjusted. This is critical so that the Vault may maintain an
 *  accurate picture of the Strategy's performance. See  `vault.report()`,
 *  `harvest()`, and `harvestTrigger()` for further details.
