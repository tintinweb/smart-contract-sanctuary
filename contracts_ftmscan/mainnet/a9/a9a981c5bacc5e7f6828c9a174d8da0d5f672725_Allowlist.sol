/**
 * @title Bridge
 * @notice This contract is responsible for cross-asset swaps using the Synthetix protocol as the bridging exchange.
 * There are three types of supported cross-asset swaps, tokenToSynth, synthToToken, and tokenToToken.
 *
 * 1) tokenToSynth
 * Swaps a supported token in a learn pool to any synthetic asset (e.g. tBTC -> sAAVE).
 *
 * 2) synthToToken
 * Swaps any synthetic asset to a suported token in a learn pool (e.g. sDEFI -> USDC).
 *
 * 3) tokenToToken
 * Swaps a supported token in a learn pool to one in another pool (e.g. renBTC -> DAI).
 *
 * Due to the settlement periods of synthetic assets, the users must wait until the trades can be completed.
 * Users will receive an ERC721 token that represents pending cross-asset swap. Once the waiting period is over,
 * the trades can be settled and completed by calling the `completeToSynth` or the `completeToToken` function.
 * In the cases of pending `synthToToken` or `tokenToToken` swaps, the owners of the pending swaps can also choose
 * to withdraw the bridging synthetic assets instead of completing the swap.

 * @title Swap - A StableSwap implementation in solidity.
 * @notice This contract is responsible for custody of closely pegged assets (eg. group of stablecoins)
 * and automatic market making system. Users become an LP (Liquidity Provider) by depositing their tokens
 * in desired ratios for an exchange of the pool token that represents their share of the pool.
 * Users can burn pool tokens and withdraw their share of token(s).
 *
 * Each time a swap between the pooled tokens happens, a set fee incurs which effectively gets
 * distributed to the LPs.
 *
 * In case of emergencies, admin can pause additional deposits, swaps, or single-asset withdraws - which
 * stops the ratio of the tokens in the pool from changing.
 * Users can always withdraw their tokens via multi-asset withdraws.
 *
 * @dev Most of the logic is stored as a library `SwapUtils` for the sake of reducing contract's
