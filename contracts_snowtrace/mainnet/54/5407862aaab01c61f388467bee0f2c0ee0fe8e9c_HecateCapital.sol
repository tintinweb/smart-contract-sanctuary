Hecate Capital : $HECATE
- You buy on AVAX, we farm on multiple chains and return the profits to $HECATE holders.

Tokenomics:
3% of each buy/sell goes to existing holders.
8% of each buy/sell will be split as follows:

65% goes into the wallet for multi-chain farming to add to the treasury and buy back HECATE tokens.
10% goes to Liquidity Incentives (this will be implemented at a future time)
20% goes to the team
5% goes to LVT buybacks
